## Day 04
# Trends, Fads and Plagiarism

---

**Fad**: fleeting behaviour, generally negative, "flavour of the month"

__Trend__: behaviour that promotes change and evolution, progress, permanent shift in direction

__Plagiarism__: no new creative input, technical deconstruction of logo to meet brand requirements

# Should we even care about trends?

Shouldn't we just try to be original and approach the solution a priori?

---

# The Value of Trends

* Understand the Zeitgeist
* Logo feels current
* Client feels "hip"
* When appropriate, trends are a quick "shorthand"


---

# Use Trends Appropriately

* Look for inspiration, not treatment
* When did a trend solve the problem?
* Think holistically - not just logo design
* What are the "macro" trends? How do they apply?
